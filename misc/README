The header files in this directory are used for the testbenches in `tb`. Those 
tests may rely on the environment being set up using the files in here. This 
entails the register file being set up with these test headers, and the xilinx 
IPs being generated as per the `xips_user.tcl` script.

# HEADERS

The `.svh` files are example header files for defining a register file.  
Codewise, the headers configure the reg_file_pkg.  These headers are not meant 
to be included in a project in this location. This is taken care of in 
m_code_manager-generated projects, because by means of its name this directory 
is not recognized as an include directory (it is not named "include"), and none 
of the files in here has an ending that is recognized as an rtl source file.
The header files can be used as starting points for own designs, since they are 
perfectly valid and (currently) complete axi register file parameterizations, 
with the correct required file names. For that purpose, the recommended way is 
copying the headers into the project's "include" directory, and editing them 
there.  Please don't use symlinks, the files in this directory are meant to not 
be touched.
